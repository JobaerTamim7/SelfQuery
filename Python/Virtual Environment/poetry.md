    - **`pip`** 
        1. **Project Dependencies** (e.g. Flask, Requests):
        
        ```bash
        pip install flask requests 
        ```
        2. **Development Tools** (e.g. Black, PyTest):
        
        ```bash
        pip install black pytest
        ```

    - **`pipx`** 
        1. **Standalone Applications/CLI** (e.g. Poetry, httpie):
        
        ```bash
        pipx install poetry httpie
        ```
        2. **CLI Tools** (e.g. awscli, youtube-dl):
        
        ```bash
        pipx install awscli youtube-dl
        ```

    #### Summary:
    - Use **`pip`** for project dependencies and development tools within a virtual environment.
    - Use **`pipx`** for installing standalone command-line applications, ensuring each tool has its own isolated environment.
    
    *Standalone Application: Apps that do not rely on external dependencies (such as libraries or frameworks), and can function independently.*
