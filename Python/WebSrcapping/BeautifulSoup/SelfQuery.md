## What is parser?
  A parser is a tool or program that takes raw data (often in the form of code, text, or structured data like HTML or JSON) and processes it to make it usable in a structured format.
  ( Process to convert data one format to another format)
  ### Key Concept in Parsing : 
  - **Breaking down input** : Takes the input (code or other structure i.g. HTML page, natural language) and break them into small parts (nodes or tockens)
  - **Analyze syntax** : Examine the tockens to fit together them according to deifnite rules.
  - **Output structure** : For ease in maintainace and manipulation of data parser often returns a tree object (Abstract Syntax Tree, DOM)
