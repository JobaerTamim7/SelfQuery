    "   - **Built-in Python parser** (no extra installation required).\n",
    "   - **Best for lightweight projects** with simple, well-structured HTML.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: Quick and easy to set up, as it comes with Python.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Less tolerant of broken or messy HTML compared to other parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`lxml`**:\n",
    "   - **Fastest parser** with advanced features like **XPath** and **XSLT** support.\n",
    "   - **Requires installation** of `lxml` library (may need additional dependencies on some systems).\n",
    "   - **Pros**: High speed and memory efficiency; handles large HTML documents well.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Not as tolerant of malformed HTML as `html5lib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`html5lib`**:\n",
    "   - **HTML5-compliant parser** that strictly follows HTML5 specifications.\n",
    "   - **Best for messy or broken HTML**; itâ€™s very lenient and similar to how browsers interpret HTML.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: Highly tolerant of errors and imperfections, ensuring well-formed output.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Slower than `lxml` and requires additional dependencies.\n",
